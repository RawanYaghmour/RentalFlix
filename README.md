# RentalFlix Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) 🎬

## Purpose of the Program
The "RentalFlix" project involves designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a movie rental service. The purpose of this ERD is to capture the key entities and relationships required to efficiently manage the service, including movie inventory, customer information, and rental records, ensuring a seamless experience for both staff and customers. 🍿🎥

## Application Specifications

### Movies 🎞️
- Each movie has a unique identifier (`MovieID`), title, genre, director, release year, and rating.
- Movies are available in multiple formats (DVD, Blu-ray, Digital).
- Each movie format has a unique identifier and may have different quantities available.

### Customers 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- Each customer has a unique `CustomerID`, name, address, phone number, and email.
- Customers can rent multiple movies but must return them within a specified period.

### Rentals 📅
- A record of each rental must be kept, including the customer who rented the movie, the movie format rented, the rental date, and the due date.
- The system should also track the return date when a movie is returned.

### Reservations 📖
- Customers can reserve movies that are currently rented out by others.
- A reservation record includes the customer ID, movie ID, reservation date, and the status of the reservation (active, fulfilled, canceled).
